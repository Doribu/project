This is a sample repository of a conventional data science project, containing the following: 
- Python scripts to generate, visualize, and plot raw data contained in the src directory.
- A dataset of the generated data contained in the data directory.
- Visualizations of the data contained in the images directory.
- A Jupyter Notebook file to generate a report contained in the reports directory. 
- Documentation of weekly meetings, data reports, and a sample output from the Jupyter Notebook report contained in the docs directory. 

The repository also contains an environment.yaml file that allows users to replicate the virtual environment required to perform this data analysis project on their own machine and operating system.
